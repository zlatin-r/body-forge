## ‚ö° Asynchronous Operations

Body Forge is designed with potential for asynchronous operations to enhance performance, particularly for I/O-bound tasks like database queries and external API calls. Views that interact heavily with the database are candidates for conversion to `async def` functions, leveraging Django's asynchronous ORM capabilities.
